#### Contained herein are the steps for setting up a basic Fedora Server (41 as of writing) installation on RPi 4
## Option 1:
**Use the script**
I have created a simple script that installs all the useful applications needed by these dotfiles. However, there are still a few steps.
*Step 1:* Using git, clone this repository to your ~/.config folder. Make sure it doesn't contain any other configs, as they will be overwritten.
*Step 2:* Run the installation script with the command ```sh ./installation.sh```
*Step 3:* Run swaywm with the command ```sway``` in the tty. Voila! These dots are installed. By running logo-key + t, you can start a terminal to allow you to familarize yourself with the dots 
## Option 2:
**Do it manually**
